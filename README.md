# Thermo_classification

The objective of this project is to predict the overall thermoacoustic stability of combustors as well as their stability in various frequency intervals using binary and multilabel classification algorithms.

## Structure of the code

The folder "Binary" (respectively "Multilabel") contains the Jupyter Notebook and corresponding input/output files for the part of the study focusing on binary (respectively multilabel) classification algorithms. In both folders, the input file is called "Cases_large.txt" and contains the geometry, flame properties and thermoacoustic stability of hundreds of thousands of randomly generated combustors in ten different frequency intervals. This data was generated using OSCILOS (https://www.oscilos.com/) A log file is also available in each folder, as well as a number of output files that can be used to reproduce the figures in the companion article.
